ATmega example, a two-channel min-max thermometer.

Uses a Dallas/Maxim 1-wire temperature sensor for one channel ("outside"),
an LM35 temperature sensor for the other channel ("inside"), and displays
the readings on an HD44780-compatible LCD display, with a PWM-controlled
backlight.

The example is configured to use an ATmega328 at 16MHz; alter the
Makefile and 1wire/polled/OWIPolled.h to change the target and clock frequency.
Alter the Makefile to select a programming device to use with avrdude.

IO connections:

LCD data and control buses use Port D (see liblcd/lcd.h):
LCD D4-D7	PD0-PD3
RS			PD4
RW			PD5
E			PD6

LCD backlight
A	PB1
K	GND

1-Wire bus:	PB3 (see 1wire/polled/OWIPolled.h)

LM35 out:	PC0

PB2 is an input to light the LCD backlight.
